# Pomodoro.js
[Pomodoro.js](https://thatisapseudo.github.io/pomodoro_timer/) is a simple nice p5.js pomodoro timer to work more efficiently and gain productivity. Work duration is set to 25 minutes and break duration is set to 5 minutes.

At start, just hit the "START" button to launch the timer, *et voil√†* ! To reset the timer, simply refresh the page.

**/!\ Warning** : this tool is aimed to be used while working on something else than your computer/phone since the timer won't work properly if the window is out of focus when the time reach 00:00 ; if this happens, the timer will simply wait for getting the focus back then start the next session. However, I'm planning on correcting this behaviour and add a sound to signal the end of a session.
Anyway, you can make something else while the timer is running, just make sure to have it open when it's getting to 00:00.

Let me know of any issue, I did not test it on every browser so I'll welcome any feedback.
