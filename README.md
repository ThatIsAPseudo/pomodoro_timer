# Pomodoro.js
Pomodoro.js is a simple nice p5.js pomodoro timer to work more efficiently and gain productivity.
Work duration is set to 25 minutes and break duration is set to 5 minutes.

At start, just hit the "START" button to launch the timer, *et voilà* !
To reset the timer, simply refresh the page.

/!\ **Warning** : this tool is aimed to be used while working on something else than your computer/phone since the timer won't work properly if the window is out of focus when the time reach 00:00 ; if this happens, the timer will simply wait for getting the focus back then start the next session. However, I'm planning on correcting this behaviour and add a sound to signal the end of a session.
Anyway, you can make something else while the timer is running, just make sure to have it open when it's getting to 00:00.
